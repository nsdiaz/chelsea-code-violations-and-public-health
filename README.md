#  Leveraging data to expand city capacity to identify and resolve housing-related public health problems

 City housing code enforcement has enormous transformative potential for public health. Achieving cities’ health and social missions, such as reducing overcrowding or asthma attacks, has remained difficult with traditional code enforcement approaches. Cities increasingly have access to digital datasets that can be used to identify and characterize housing-related health risks and prioritize these properties for inspection. However, code enforcement has limited effectiveness in addressing health and housing problems. This is because cities are not aware of problems soon enough and inspections are often reactive or rely only on inspectors’ tacit knowledge.
 
 ## Scope

In 2014, Chelsea, MA, a small, densely populated, majority-minority city near Boston, implemented a proactive program to inspect all rental properties over a 5-year period. The sanitary code violations resulting from these inspections, as well as data on police and fire calls, the census, and other sources were aggregated and linked by property.

## Analysis

## Python

This project uses the Python programming language. To work in Python, we recommend downloading the latest [ANACONDA].

Within Python, we use the `pandas` library for dataframe manipulation and analysis and the `sklearn` library for running supervised learning models. Additionally, we leverage the following libraries:
